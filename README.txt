QGIS Remote Control Plugin
--------------------------

This plugin let you connect severel QGIS instances and shares the canvas extent.
The plugin sets up a TCP network server. So its possible to connect clients on
the same or from different mashines.

How to work with
----------------
- start the server with the toolbar button
- connect the clients (all clients should be in the client list of the configuration dock widget)
- check the sync button in all qgis clients you want to sync
- move the map...the center point and zoomlevel should be the same on all instances

The plugin is highly experimental.
